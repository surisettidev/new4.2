Set these using `wrangler secret put VARIABLE_NAME`:

```bash
# OAuth Configuration
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=your_discord_client_id  
DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET=your_discord_client_secret

# Admin Configuration
ADMIN_PASSWORD=Yethical  # Change this!

# Google Sheets Integration
GOOGLE_SHEETS_API_KEY=your_google_sheets_api_key
GOOGLE_SHEET_ID=your_google_sheet_id

# Security
